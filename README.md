# Additional Checkout Scripts for Shopify that Don't Suck.

* The following Additional Checkout Scripts generate a decent Data Layer that you can call with Google Tag Manager.
* A number of recipes are included for common attribution pixels that you might want to load on the TY Page.

***NOTE: This is a WIP...***

## How to Use

1. Update the data layer object namespace if you don't like `fueled`.
2. In the section with the comment `BEGIN: Add Pixel Variables here`, Assign pixel variables. This will conditionally load the corresponding scripts.
